# Interactive-Digital-Systems
IDS Project: Interactive Digital Systems

This project is about creating interactive digital systems, and we have chosen to work with idea 4 from our lecture. Idea 4 is a combination of idea #1 and idea #3, and it includes the following:

Use a keycard to gain access.

Use a simple JSON database in p5.js.

ESP32: LEDs (Valid/Invalid) + MFRC522.

Idea #4 combines facial recognition and door control to create an advanced access system. The system uses a keycard to grant access and a simple JSON database in p5.js to manage user data. An ESP32 device controls LEDs that indicate valid or invalid access, and an MFRC522 RFID reader to scan keycards.
